## 📁 Dataset

- Input: 10. Market Basket Analysis.csv
- Field Used: aisle – representing product categories or items.
- Simulated Data: 500 customer transactions generated by randomly sampling aisles.

## 🚀 Features

1. Association Rule Mining (Apriori)
- Discovers frequent itemsets.
- Generates association rules using support ≥ 0.05 and confidence ≥ 0.3.
- Helps identify item combinations commonly purchased together.

2. Customer Classification
- Labels customers as High Spenders (purchased > 4 items) or Low Spenders.
- Logistic Regression model trained to predict spending category.
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix.

3. Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
- Applies K-Means clustering to group customers based on their aisle preferences.
- PCA is used for dimensionality reduction and visualization of customer clusters.
